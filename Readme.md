##
由于最近一直在关心 parser 的机制, 所以研究了几个库的源码, 
  * https://github.com/CrazyFork/the-super-tiny-compiler
  * https://github.com/CrazyFork/thrift-parser
  * 还有这个
  * 一会儿我将看 scala 写的 json parser.
  

* /thrust-parser
  * 这个是我主要关注的模块, 实现的parser还是挺优雅的就代码上来说。首先这个parser用next_token方法隔离了没有用的字符串。只是一个个合法的token，然后再根据 bump 方法去更新 token 的值



todos：

* thrift 的namespace到底是啥意思
* PartialEq vs Eq,


# Thrust [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thehydroimpulse/thrust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thehydroimpulse/thrust)

**Note:** A work in progress. It's not in a useful state right now.

A Rust implementation of the [Apache Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) protocol that simplifies communicating between independent systems that may be implemented in various languages.

## Features

- Scalable Thrift RPC
- Rust code generator from a `.thrift` file.
- Built on-top of Asynchronous I/O via Mio.
- Heavily uses Futures to manage asynchronous code.
- Multiplexing multiple RPC services on a single event-loop.
- (Currently limited to one for now) Automatically spawn an `EventLoop` per CPU core.

## Installing

```toml
[dependencies]
thrust = "*"
```

You may also want to install the code generator using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install thrust
```

## Generating Rust Code

Thrust comes with a `thrust` binary that compiles your `.thrift` files into Rust code.

```bash
thrust hello.thrift .
```

The first argument is the input thrift file and the second is the *path* where you want your
Rust file to be written to. The filename will be based on the Rust namespace in your thrift file `namespace rust <name>`.

## Spawning The Reactor

All the I/O and networking is built using Mio. By default, a single Reactor is spun up globally. Support for multiple event loops/Reactors are supported but not working correctly right now.

```rust
use thrust::Reactor;

fn main() {
  // Run the reactor that multiplexes many clients and servers.
  Reactor::run();
}
```

## Creating a Thrift Service

Thrust supports creating Thrift services, backed by non-blocking TCP sockets with Mio.

```thrift
namespace rust thrift;
// Start by defining a service in your Thrift file.
service Flock {
  bool isLoggedIn(1: string token);
}
```

After using Thrust to generate the service in Rust, we can start using it.

```rust
extern crate thrust;
// Tangle is a futures implementation
extern crate tangle;

// The generated Rust module.
use thrift::Flock;

use thrust::{Reactor, Server};
use tangle::{Future, Async};

pub struct FlockService;

impl Flock for FlockService {
  fn isLoggedIn(&mut self, token: String) -> Future<bool> {
    if &*token == "123" {
      Async::Ok(true)
    } else {
      Async::Ok(false)
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:7899".parse().unwrap();

  // Asynchronously bind the server to the specified port. This does
  // not block the current thread.
  Server::new(FlockService).bind(addr);

  // Run the Reactor with the server.
  Reactor::run();
}
```

## Connecting to a Service

A client is automatically generated for each service you define in your `.thrift` file. Let's keep using our previously defined service as an example.

```rust
extern crate thrust;
// Tangle is a futures implementation
extern crate tangle;

// The generated Rust module.
use thrift::{Flock, Client};

use thrust::Reactor;
use tangle::{Future, Async};

fn main() {
  let addr: SocketAddr = "127.0.0.1:7899".parse().unwrap();

  // Connect to the service
  let flock = Client::connect(addr);

  // Initiate an RPC call
  flock.isLoggedIn("123").and_then(move |is| {
    if is == true {
      println!("You're logged in!")
    } else {
      println!("Nada");
    }

    Async::Ok(())
  });

  // Just as before, running the Reactor is required.
  Reactor::run();
}
```

Remember, Thrust is built using asynchronous primitives and futures are currently the common language for asynchronous tasks. Futures prevent much of the problems in traditional callback-based systems.

```rust
enum Error {
  AccessDenied
}

flock.isLoggedIn("123").and_then(move |is_logged_in| {
  if is_logged_in == true {
    Async::Ok(())
  } else {
    Async::Err(Error::AccessDenied)
  }
}).and_then(move || {
  // This will only run if the user has been logged in. Errors
  // can be caught later on.

  // ... Do some other fun stuff here.
  Async::Ok(())
}).error(move |err| {
  Async::Err(err)
})
```

## Sharing Clients

You might want to share clients across threads and that's perfectly supported! Clients are fully clone-able and are thread-safe.

```rust
let shared = client.clone();

thread::spawn(move || {
  shared...
})
```

This will re-use the same connection underneath. All TCP connections run in a single Mio event loop (baring multiple event loops). If you wish to use multiple connections, you may create a new client.
